# Building Escape

Implementation of the Building Escape Unreal game, presented in Section 3 of the Udemy Unreal Course (<https://www.udemy.com/unrealcourse>)

## Notes

* This project is currently incomplete. It will be completed as Section 3 of the course is completed.

* The Unreal StarterContent pack is required to render objects in this game. This content is freely available when you install the Unreal engine and is not included here as it is static data that is quite large. To run the game, you will need to copy the Unreal StarterContent directory to `./Content/StarterContent`
